#Recently updated!

#Bagsy: A DataBroker Plugin

The screenshot below will tell you everything you'll need to know about this plugin, but basically it's all about bag information (free slots, taken slots, that kind of thing).

#What is DataBroker?

DataBroker is part of a system that's similar to FuBar and its plugins, what you have here is a plugin but you'll also need something to display the output of the plugin.  You have many options for this, and I've listed a number of them below for your perusal, just pick the one that interests you the most.

##2.4.3-0.3

- I've got a new direction with the tooltips, it took me a while to decide on this.  It was discussed with a few people too and it was generally and mutually decided that the new direction I'm taking them in is better.  So this is the New Unification of Tooltip Styles for my plugins.  NUTS v1!  I'm pretty much going to model all my DataBroker plugins after this layout, to try to keep them as easy to understand at a glance as possible.  The basic idea is: Keybinds at the bottom, the most important information at the top, and all the straggler-lines cushioned in the middle.  Credit where credit is due, too; this all started because of a suggestion by Nyte, so kudos for Nyte for giving me reason to think about all this!  This is far too long for a changelog update, I know... but necessary!
- I've corrected the toc-version, I am scared and confused by toc-versions.
