#Bagsy: A DataBroker Plugin for World of Warcraft

***You must have an LDB display addon for Basgy to work.***

The screenshot below will tell you everything you'll need to know about this plugin, but basically it's all about bag information - free slots, taken slots, that kind of thing.

Set the options in the GUI, and submit tickets on [GitHub (preferred)](https://github.com/xtoq/bagsy/issues), [CurseForge](https://wow.curseforge.com/addons/bagsy/tickets/) or [WoWInterface](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info10599-Bagsy.html#comments) if you run into problems.
